		IMPORTANT: To All Contributers
		Each permission is given an ID. Permissions are stored by their IDs into to a variable-sized list and then stored to a persistent database. Any changes to the existing IDs will break backwards compatibility with older versions of the server and may also create security problems by granting accounts permissions they did not have in prior versions of the server. Thus, all new permissions need to be appended to the end of this list. It is considered best practice to give new permissions IDs that are much higher (at least a couple hundered or thousand) than the last one already on the list when creating a new permission to use in development, and then get a proper ID assigned upon merging into the main tree and/or a release branch.
